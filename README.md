# ZonaSul_crawler

The project located in this repository has to the purpose to gather name and price data of all products in the target website, store it in a database and analyze it.

The target website www.zonasul.com.br is a grocery delivery companie in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

Here is a brief description of each file:

 - zsbot.py

This is the crawler itself. In here you will find all the functions that crawl the website, get the data and organize it to be stored

 - db_input.py

This simple file uploads the data gathered in zsbot.py and upload it to the database

 - Retrieve_data_from_ZSBot.ipynb

This is a Jupyter notebook that I created to vizualy access the data
As there are a lot of charts and data visualization in this file, I highly recommend to run it with a Jupyter notebook installed in your computer (http://jupyter.org/)

WHAT YOU WILL FIND

My purpose here is to practice python skills. Most of my effort was to create the crawler itself.

WHAT I EXPECT

Please, feel free to download, evaluate, analyze, comment and give me feedback on my work. I truly believe that people grow with constructive feedback. I'm very excited to hear what you have to say about my work.

Have fun
